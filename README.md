# goManageDocker

Do Docker commands slip your mind because you don't use Docker often enough? Sick of googling commands for everyday tasks? GoManageDocker is designed to NUKE this annoyance. 

Introducing **goManageDocker** (get it?)! This blazing fast TUI, made using Go and BubbleTea, will make managing your Docker objects a breeze.

## Install Instructions

### Unix

You can install the latest release of goManageDocker on UNIX systems with a simple bash script:

```
bash -c "$(curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajayd-san/gomanagedocker/main/install.sh)"
```

This is the recommended way to install on Linux(`amd64` only) and MacOS(both `intel` and `arm`) systems. 
Start the program with `gmd`. 

### Windows

Building from source is currently the only way to install this on Windows. See next section. 

### Build from source

Just build like any other Go binary, this is currently the only way to make goManageDocker work on Windows and arm64 chipsets running **Linux**: 

```
go install github.com/ajayd-san/gomanagedocker@main
```

Start the program with `gomanagedocker` (Rename it to `gmd` if you'd like, the binary will be installed at your `$GOPATH`).


### Docker
Want to try this without installing a binary? I gotchu!

**Docker:**

```
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock kakshipth/gomanagedocker:latest
```

**Podman:**

First start the podman service: 

```
systemctl --user start podman.socket
```

And then: 
```
docker run -it -v /run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock:/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock kakshipth/gomanagedocker:latest p
```

Alias it to something quicker (unless you like typing a lot üôÑ)

## Quick Start

### docker

To connect to the docker service: 
```
gmd 
```


### podman

First start the podman service: 

```
systemctl --user start podman.socket
```

(replace `start` with `enable` if you'd like to start it during every boot)

To connect to the podman service: 

```
gmd p 
```

(Issuing the subcommand `p` connects to the podman socket)

> [!NOTE]
> The command to invoke the TUI changes depending on the install method, if you installed from source you would be typing `gomanagedocker` instead of `gmd` (unless you aliased it to `gmd`).


Now, **goManageDocker üòè!!**

> [!NOTE]
> goManageDocker runs best on terminals that support ANSI 256 colors and designed to run while the **terminal is maximized**.

## Features

### **New in v1.5:**

1. goManageDocker now has first class support for Podman!! (who doesn't like more secure containers üòâ). You can now manage podman images, containers, volumes and even pods from the TUI!

### **Previous release features:**


1. Easy navigation with vim keybinds and arrow keys.
   ![intro](vhs/gifs/intro.gif)

2. Exec into selected container with A SINGLE KEYSTROKE: `x`...How cool is that?
   ![exec](vhs/gifs/exec.gif)

3. Delete objects using `d` (You can force delete with `D`, you won't have to answer a prompt this way)
   ![delete](vhs/gifs/delete.gif)

4. Prune objects using `p`
   ![prune](vhs/gifs/prune.gif)

5. start/stop/pause/restart containers with `s`, `t` and `r`
   ![startstop](vhs/gifs/startstop.gif)

6. Filter objects with `/`
   ![search](vhs/gifs/search.gif)
   
7. Perfrom docker scout with `s`
   ![scout](vhs/gifs/scout.gif)
   
8. Run an image directly from the image tab by pressing `r`.
   ![runImage](vhs/gifs/runImage.gif) 
   
9. You can directly copy the ID to your clipboard of an object by pressing `c`.
   ![copyId](vhs/gifs/copyId.gif)
   
10. You can now run and exec into an image directly from the images tab with  `x`

## Configuration

I've added support for config files from V1.2.

Place `gomanagedocker/gomanagedocker.yaml` in your XDG config folder and configure to your heart's content!

Default Configuration:  

```
config:
  Polling-Time: 500
  Tab-Order:
    Docker: [images, containers, volumes]
    Podman: [images, containers, volumes, pods]
  Notification-Timeout: 2000

```

- Polling-Time: Set how frequently the program calls the docker API (measured in milliseconds, default: 500ms)
- Tab-Order: Define the order of tabs displayed for Docker and Podman. Each key specifies the tab order for its respective environment. Valid tabs include `images`, `containers`, `volumes`, and `pods` (for Podman only). You can omit tabs you don‚Äôt wish to display.
- Notification-Timeout: Set how long a status message sticks around for (measured in milliseconds, default: 2000ms)

## Roadmap

- Add a networks tab
- ~~Make compatible with podman üëÄ~~
