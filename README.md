# goManageDocker

Do Docker commands slip your mind because you don't use Docker often enough? Sick of googling commands for everyday tasks? GoManageDocker is designed to NUKE this annoyance. 

Introducing **goManageDocker** (get it?)! This blazing fast TUI, made using Go and BubbleTea, will make managing your Docker objects a breeze.

## Install Instructions

### Unix

You can install the latest release of goManageDocker on UNIX systems with a simple bash script:

```
bash -c "$(curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajayd-san/gomanagedocker/main/install.sh)"
```

Start the program with `gmd`. 

### Build from source

Just build like any other Go binary: 

```
go install github.com/ajayd-san/gomanagedocker@main
```

Start the program with `gomanagedocker` (Rename it to `gmd` if you'd like, the binary will be installed at your `$GOPATH`).

### Windows

You can get the latest precompiled binary from releases or you may build from source. 

Now, **goManageDocker üòè!!**

> [!NOTE]
> goManageDocker runs best on terminals that support ANSI 256 colors and designed to run while the **terminal is maximized**.

### Docker
Want to try this without installing a binary? I gotchu!

```
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock kakshipth/gomanagedocker:latest
```

Alias it to something quicker (unless you like typing a lot üôÑ)

## Configuration

I've added support for config files from V1.2.

Place `gomanagedocker/gomanagedocker.yaml` in your XDG config folder and configure to your heart's content!

Default Configuration:  

```
config:
  Polling-Time: 500
  Tab-Order: [images, containers, volumes]
  Notification-timeout: 2000
```

- Polling-Time: Set how frequently the program calls the docker API (measured in milliseconds, default: 500ms)
- Tab-Order: Set the order of tabs displayed, the keys must be `images`, `containers` and `volumes`. You can omit the names of the tabs you do not wish to see as well. Say I want to see `containers` tab first and do not want to see the `volumes` tab, I can set `Tab-Order: [containers, images]`
- Notification-Timeout: Set how long a status message sticks around for (measured in milliseconds, default: 2000ms)

## Roadmap

- Add a networks tab
- Make compatible with podman üëÄ
